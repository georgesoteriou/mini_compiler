Project management:

    Git: Our repository was set up in such a way that the master branch only ever contained fully working, production quality
         code. For each of the three tasks, a develop branch existed (frontend, backend and extensions) to which features were added.
         Any new branches were branched off of these branches, and features were merged into this branch, before being debugged and pushed
         to master. This ensured that we always had a good workflow in that we were able to implement independent features without having to
         merge from other branches, or having to worry about merge conflicts across entirely unrelated branches.

    Organization: We made use of pair programming, so that any code being written had at least two people looking at it and ensuring its correctness.
                  Upon merging into the develop branch for each of the extensions, we sat down as a group and made sure that everyone was brought up
                  speed with the new features being added.
