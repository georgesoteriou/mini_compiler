# This program is interactive. We implement a hash table containing integers and we play with it.
#
# A hash table is represented by an array of node lists. Each node in a node list is represented
# by pair(int, pair). The first element of the pair is the integer at that node, the second element
# is the pointer to the next node (or null if no more node).
#
# Integers those mapped to the same index are stored on the list (in any order) in that index.
